### Smart Contract: 3-1X_2C_ThresholdVotingContract.sol

#### Overview
This smart contract implements a threshold voting mechanism using the ERC777 standard. It requires a predefined number of votes or a certain percentage of tokens to support a proposal for it to pass. This is ideal for governance systems where a high degree of consensus is necessary.

### Contract Explanation

1. **Contract Type**: This is a threshold voting contract using the ERC777 standard. It requires a predefined number of votes or a certain percentage of tokens to support a proposal for it to pass. This is particularly useful in governance systems where a large degree of consensus is necessary.

2. **Core Functionalities**:
   - `createProposal`: Allows the contract owner to create a proposal with a title, description, and custom threshold.
   - `vote`: Allows token holders to vote on proposals. Voting power is determined by the token balance of the voter.
   - `executeProposal`: Allows the owner to execute a proposal after the voting period has ended, based on the threshold rule.
   - `depositFunds`: Allows the contract owner to deposit funds into the contract for proposals requiring fund allocations.
   - `emergencyWithdraw`: Allows the owner to withdraw the contract balance in case of an emergency.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks.
   - **Ownable**: Restricts proposal creation, fund deposit, and execution to the contract owner.
   - **HasVoted Mapping**: Ensures that each address can only vote once per proposal.
   - **Threshold Check**: Ensures that a proposal can only be executed if it reaches the predefined threshold.

4. **Events**:
   - `ProposalCreated`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
   - `Voted`: Emitted when a token holder votes on a proposal.
   - `ProposalExecuted`: Emitted when a proposal is successfully executed.
   - `FundDeposited`: Emitted when funds are deposited into the contract.

5. **Modifiers**:
   - `nonReentrant`: Ensures no reentrancy is possible during the `vote` function.
   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to certain functions like fund management and proposal execution.

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Ensure you have the required `votingToken` address (ERC777 token contract address).
   - Specify the `votingDuration` in seconds (e.g., 1 week = 604800 seconds).
   - Specify the `defaultThreshold` for proposals.

2. **Deploy Script**:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
       // Define contract variables
       const VotingTokenAddress = "<ERC777 Token Contract Address>";
       const VotingDuration = 604800; // 1 week in seconds
       const DefaultThreshold = 1000 * 10**18; // Threshold in tokens (e.g., 1000 tokens)

       // Get the contract factory and deploy
       const ThresholdVotingContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("ThresholdVotingContract");
       const thresholdVotingContract = await ThresholdVotingContract.deploy(VotingTokenAddress, VotingDuration, DefaultThreshold);

       // Wait for deployment to complete
       await thresholdVotingContract.deployed();

       console.log("ThresholdVotingContract deployed to:", thresholdVotingContract.address);
   }

   // Execute the script
   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

3. **Verification & Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for the `createProposal`, `vote`, `executeProposal`, `depositFunds`, and `emergencyWithdraw` functions.
   - Use a local Ethereum test network (e.g., Hardhat) for initial testing.
   - Verify the contract on Etherscan using the contract source code.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Provide an API documentation detailing function inputs, outputs, and events.
   - Include user guides for interacting with the contract (creating proposals, voting, etc.).

5. **Additional Customizations**:
   - Implement more complex proposal

 execution logic (e.g., fund transfers or state changes).
   - Add features like dynamic thresholds or multi-phase voting periods.
   - Include a UI for easier interaction with the contract.

This smart contract is structured to offer a robust threshold voting mechanism using ERC777 tokens, incorporating industry standards and security best practices.
