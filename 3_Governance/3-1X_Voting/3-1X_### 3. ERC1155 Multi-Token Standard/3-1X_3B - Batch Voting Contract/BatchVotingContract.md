### Smart Contract: 3-1X_3B_BatchVotingContract.sol

#### Overview
This smart contract allows ERC1155 token holders to participate in batch voting, where multiple proposals can be voted on in a single transaction. This feature reduces gas costs and simplifies the voting process for token holders who need to vote on multiple issues at once.

### Contract Explanation

1. **Contract Type**: The contract uses the ERC1155 multi-token standard and enables batch voting. It allows token holders to vote on multiple proposals in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and simplifying the voting process.

2. **Core Functionalities**:
   - `createProposal`: Allows the contract owner to create a new proposal with a title, description, and voting deadline.
   - `batchVote`: Allows token holders to vote on multiple proposals using multiple token IDs in a single transaction.
   - `executeProposal`: Allows the owner to execute a proposal after the voting period has ended, based on a simple majority rule.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks.
   - **Ownable**: Restricts proposal creation and execution to the contract owner.
   - **HasVoted Mapping**: Ensures that each address can only vote once per token ID per proposal.

4. **Events**:
   - `ProposalCreated`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
   - `BatchVoted`: Emitted when a batch vote is executed by a token holder.
   - `ProposalExecuted`: Emitted when a proposal is successfully executed.

5. **Modifiers**:
   - `nonReentrant`: Ensures no reentrancy is possible during the `batchVote` function.
   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to certain functions like creating and executing proposals.

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Ensure you have the required `votingToken` address (ERC1155 token contract address).
   - Specify the `votingDuration` in seconds (e.g., 1 week = 604800 seconds).

2. **Deploy Script**:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
       // Define contract variables
       const VotingTokenAddress = "<ERC1155 Token Contract Address>";
       const VotingDuration = 604800; // 1 week in seconds

       // Get the contract factory and deploy
       const BatchVotingContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("BatchVotingContract");
       const batchVotingContract = await BatchVotingContract.deploy(VotingTokenAddress, VotingDuration);

       // Wait for deployment to complete
       await batchVotingContract.deployed();

       console.log("BatchVotingContract deployed to:", batchVotingContract.address);
   }

   // Execute the script
   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

3. **Verification & Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for the `createProposal`, `batchVote`, `executeProposal`, and `setVotingDuration` functions.
   - Use a local Ethereum test network (e.g., Hardhat) for initial testing.
   - Verify the contract on Etherscan using the contract source code.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Provide an API documentation detailing function inputs, outputs, and events.
   - Include user guides for interacting with the contract (creating proposals, batch voting, etc.).

5. **Additional Customizations**:
   - Implement more complex proposal execution logic (e.g., multi-step governance changes).
   - Add features like weighted voting based on token value or different classes of tokens.
   - Include a UI for easier interaction with the contract.

This smart contract is structured to offer a robust batch voting mechanism using ERC1155 tokens, incorporating industry standards and security best practices.
