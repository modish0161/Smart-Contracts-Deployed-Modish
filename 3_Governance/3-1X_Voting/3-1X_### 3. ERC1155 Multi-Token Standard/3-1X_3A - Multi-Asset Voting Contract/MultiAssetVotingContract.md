### Smart Contract: 3-1X_3A_MultiAssetVotingContract.sol

#### Overview
This smart contract enables ERC1155 token holders to participate in governance decisions, with voting power distributed based on the value or weight of each token type. This is ideal for platforms where different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, commodities) are tokenized and represented in the voting process.

### Contract Explanation

1. **Contract Type**: The contract uses the ERC1155 multi-token standard, allowing holders of multiple types of tokens to participate in governance decisions. It supports a voting mechanism where the weight of each vote is based on the balance of each token type held by a voter.

2. **Core Functionalities**:
   - `createProposal`: Allows the contract owner to create a new proposal with a title, description, and voting deadline.
   - `vote`: Allows token holders to vote on proposals with a specific token ID, contributing their vote weight based on their balance of that token type.
   - `executeProposal`: Allows the owner to execute a proposal after the voting period has ended, based on a simple majority rule.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks.
   - **Ownable**: Restricts proposal creation and execution to the contract owner.
   - **HasVoted Mapping**: Ensures that each address can only vote once per token ID per proposal.

4. **Events**:
   - `ProposalCreated`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
   - `Voted`: Emitted when a token holder votes on a proposal.
   - `ProposalExecuted`: Emitted when a proposal is successfully executed.

5. **Modifiers**:
   - `nonReentrant`: Ensures no reentrancy is possible during the `vote` function.
   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to certain functions like creating and executing proposals.

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Ensure you have the required `votingToken` address (ERC1155 token contract address).
   - Specify the `votingDuration` in seconds (e.g., 1 week = 604800 seconds).

2. **Deploy Script**:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
       // Define contract variables
       const VotingTokenAddress = "<ERC1155 Token Contract Address>";
       const VotingDuration = 604800; // 1 week in seconds

       // Get the contract factory and deploy
       const MultiAssetVotingContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MultiAssetVotingContract");
       const multiAssetVotingContract = await MultiAssetVotingContract.deploy(VotingTokenAddress, VotingDuration);

       // Wait for deployment to complete
       await multiAssetVotingContract.deployed();

       console.log("MultiAssetVotingContract deployed to:", multiAssetVotingContract.address);
   }

   // Execute the script
   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

3. **Verification & Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for the `createProposal`, `vote`, `executeProposal`, and `setVotingDuration` functions.
   - Use a local Ethereum test network (e.g., Hardhat) for initial testing.
   - Verify the contract on Etherscan using the contract source code.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Provide an API documentation detailing function inputs, outputs, and events.
   - Include user guides for interacting with the contract (creating proposals, voting, etc.).

5. **Additional Customizations**:
   - Implement more complex proposal execution logic (e.g., multi-step governance changes).
   - Add features like weighted voting based on token value or different classes of tokens.
   - Include a UI for easier interaction with the contract.

This smart contract is structured to offer a robust multi-asset voting mechanism using ERC1155 tokens, incorporating industry standards and security best practices.
