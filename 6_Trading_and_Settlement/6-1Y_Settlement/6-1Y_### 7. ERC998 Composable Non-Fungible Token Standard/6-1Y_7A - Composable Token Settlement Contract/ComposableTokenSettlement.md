### Smart Contract: `ComposableTokenSettlement.sol`

Below is the Solidity implementation for the **6-1Y_7A - Composable Token Settlement Contract** using the ERC998 standard. This contract handles the settlement of trades involving composable tokens, ensuring that all components (parent and child assets) are securely and instantly transferred upon trade execution.

### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Composable Settlement**:
   - The contract handles the settlement of trades involving composable tokens (ERC998). The settlement includes transferring both the parent token and all child assets associated with it.

2. **Settlement Creation and Execution**:
   - The `createSettlement` function allows for the creation of settlement agreements between a buyer and a seller.
   - The `executeSettlement` function finalizes the settlement by transferring the parent token and the agreed price.

3. **Authorization and Control**:
   - Only the contract owner can create settlements, ensuring that trades involving composable tokens are verified.

4. **Emergency Pause**:
   - The contract includes a pause mechanism to stop settlement creation and execution in case of emergencies.

5. **Event Emissions**:
   - Events are emitted for settlement creation (`SettlementCreated`) and settlement execution (`SettlementExecuted`) to ensure transparency.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Save the contract in `contracts/ComposableTokenSettlement.sol` and compile it:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deployment Script**:
   Create a deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const ComposableTokenSettlement = await ethers.getContractFactory("ComposableTokenSettlement");
     const composableTokenSettlement = await ComposableTokenSettlement.deploy("Composable Token Settlement", "CTS");

     console.log("ComposableTokenSettlement deployed to:", composableTokenSettlement.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Additional Customization:

- **Advanced Asset Management**: Include more detailed asset management features like nested ownership transfers and automated valuation.
- **Compliance Checks**: Integrate with a compliance provider to enforce KYC/AML checks before settlements.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Add on-chain governance for approving settlements and managing composable assets.

Feel free to ask if you need further customization or additional features!
