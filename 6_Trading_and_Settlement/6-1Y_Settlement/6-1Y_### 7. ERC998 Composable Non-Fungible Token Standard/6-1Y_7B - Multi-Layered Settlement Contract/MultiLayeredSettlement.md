### Smart Contract: `MultiLayeredSettlement.sol`

Below is the Solidity implementation for the **6-1Y_7B - Multi-Layered Settlement Contract** using the ERC998 standard. This contract handles the settlement of trades involving composable tokens at multiple layers of ownership, ensuring that both the parent token and its underlying assets are transferred and settled securely and instantly.

### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Multi-Layered Settlement**:
   - The contract supports settlement at multiple layers of composable token ownership. Both the parent token and its underlying child assets are transferred securely and instantly.

2. **Trade Creation and Execution**:
   - The `createTrade` function allows the creation of trade agreements between a buyer and a seller.
   - The `executeTrade` function finalizes the trade by transferring the parent token and all associated child tokens from the seller to the buyer.

3. **Authorization and Control**:
   - Only the contract owner can create trades, ensuring that all trades involving composable tokens are verified.
   - The buyer must call the `executeTrade` function, ensuring only authorized participants can finalize the settlement.

4. **Emergency Pause**:
   - The contract includes a pause mechanism to stop trade creation and execution in case of emergencies.

5. **Event Emissions**:
   - Events are emitted for trade creation (`TradeCreated`) and trade execution (`TradeExecuted`) to ensure transparency.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Save the contract in `contracts/MultiLayeredSettlement.sol` and compile it:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deployment Script**:
   Create a deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const MultiLayeredSettlement = await ethers.getContractFactory("MultiLayeredSettlement");
     const multiLayeredSettlement = await MultiLayeredSettlement.deploy("Multi-Layered Settlement Token", "MLST");

     console.log("MultiLayeredSettlement deployed to:", multiLayeredSettlement.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Additional Customization:

- **Advanced Asset Management**: Include more detailed asset management features like nested ownership transfers and automated valuation.
- **Compliance Checks**: Integrate with a compliance provider to enforce KYC/AML checks before trade creation and execution.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Add on-chain governance for approving trades and managing composable assets.

Feel free to ask if you need further customization or additional features!
