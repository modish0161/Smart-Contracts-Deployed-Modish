### Contract Name: `VaultTokenSettlement.sol`

Below is the Solidity implementation for the **6-1Y_6A - Vault Token Settlement Contract** using the ERC4626 standard. This contract is designed to ensure automatic and instant settlement of trades involving vault-based tokens, allowing participants to exchange their shares of pooled assets efficiently.

### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Trade Creation**:
   - The contract owner can create trades using the `createTrade` function, specifying a unique trade ID, buyer, seller, token amount, and vault shares.

2. **Automated Settlement**:
   - The `settleTrade` function ensures the transfer of tokens and vault shares between the buyer and seller upon settlement, automatically handling both sides of the trade.

3. **Emergency Pause**:
   - The contract can be paused by the owner in case of an emergency, preventing further trade creation and settlement.

4. **Event Emissions**:
   - Events are emitted for trade creation (`TradeCreated`) and trade settlement (`TradeSettled`) to ensure transparency.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Save the contract in `contracts/VaultTokenSettlement.sol` and compile it:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deployment Script**:
   Create a deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const VaultTokenAddress = "0xYourVaultTokenAddress"; // Replace with your ERC4626 token address

     const VaultTokenSettlement = await ethers.getContractFactory("VaultTokenSettlement");
     const vaultTokenSettlement = await VaultTokenSettlement.deploy(VaultTokenAddress);

     console.log("VaultTokenSettlement deployed to:", vaultTokenSettlement.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Additional Customization:

- **Governance Mechanism**: Add on-chain governance for approving trades and managing vault operations.
- **Automated Compliance**: Integrate with a third-party compliance provider (e.g., Chainalysis) to automate compliance checks for trades.
- **Oracle Integration**: Use Chainlink or another oracle to fetch real-time pricing data and asset values for vault shares.
