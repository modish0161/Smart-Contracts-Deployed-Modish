### Smart Contract: `PooledAssetSettlement.sol`

Below is the Solidity implementation for the **6-1Y_6C - Pooled Asset Settlement Contract** using the ERC4626 standard. This contract is designed to handle the settlement of trades involving pooled assets in tokenized vaults, ensuring that settlement is completed instantly and participants receive their proportional share of the vault’s assets.

### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Proportional Settlement**:
   - The contract calculates the settled amount for each participant based on the number of vault shares they hold and the current asset value of the vault.

2. **Authorized Participants**:
   - Only authorized participants (defined by the owner) can create settlements, ensuring that only verified participants engage in trades involving pooled assets.

3. **Settlement Creation and Execution**:
   - The `createSettlement` function allows authorized participants to create settlements with specific conditions.
   - The `executeSettlement` function finalizes the settlement by transferring the appropriate shares and amount from the vault to the participant.

4. **Emergency Pause**:
   - The contract includes a pause mechanism to stop settlement creation and execution in case of emergencies.

5. **Event Emissions**:
   - Events are emitted for settlement creation (`SettlementCreated`) and settlement execution (`SettlementExecuted`) to ensure transparency.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Save the contract in `contracts/PooledAssetSettlement.sol` and compile it:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deployment Script**:
   Create a deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const VaultTokenAddress = "0xYourVaultTokenAddress"; // Replace with your ERC4626 token address

     const PooledAssetSettlement = await ethers.getContractFactory("PooledAssetSettlement");
     const pooledAssetSettlement = await PooledAssetSettlement.deploy(VaultTokenAddress);

     console.log("PooledAssetSettlement deployed to:", pooledAssetSettlement.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Additional Customization:

- **Advanced Settlement Calculation**: Integrate the vault’s actual asset and share valuation logic into the `calculateSettledAmount` function.
- **Automated Compliance**: Integrate with a third-party compliance provider to automate KYC/AML checks.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Add on-chain governance for approving settlements and managing vault operations.
