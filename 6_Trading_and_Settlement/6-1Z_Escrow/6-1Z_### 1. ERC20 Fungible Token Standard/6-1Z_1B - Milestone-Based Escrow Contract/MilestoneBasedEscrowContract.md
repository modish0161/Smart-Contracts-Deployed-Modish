### Smart Contract: `MilestoneBasedEscrowContract.sol`

Below is the Solidity implementation for the **6-1Z_1B - Milestone-Based Escrow Contract** using the ERC20 standard. This contract securely holds ERC20 tokens in escrow and releases funds incrementally as predefined milestones are achieved. This is ideal for long-term agreements, ensuring that the parties are incentivized to complete their obligations step-by-step.

### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Milestone-Based Fund Release**:
   - The contract allows the depositor to create multiple milestones, each specifying a certain amount of ERC20 tokens and a release time. The beneficiary can only release funds once the release time is reached, providing a structured way to disburse payments.

2. **Deposits**:
   - The depositor can deposit ERC20 tokens into the contract using the `depositFunds` function. The contract keeps track of the total amount deposited and allocates funds to milestones.

3. **Milestone Creation**:
   - The depositor can create milestones using the `createMilestone` function, specifying the amount and the release time for each milestone. The total deposited funds are decreased by the milestone amount.

4. **Fund Release**:
   - The beneficiary can release the funds for a specific milestone using the `releaseMilestone` function once the release time has been reached and the milestone has not already been released.

5. **Refund and Contract Termination**:
   - The depositor can refund any remaining funds if the contract is terminated, provided all milestones are completed or not initiated. The contract can be terminated only if no further milestones need to be released.

6. **Security**:
   - The contract is secure with built-in protections against reentrancy attacks (`nonReentrant` modifier), proper ownership and role management (`Ownable`), and checks to prevent unauthorized access to funds and functions.

7. **Event Logging**:
   - Events such as `MilestoneCreated`, `MilestoneCompleted`, `FundsRefunded`, and `ContractTerminated` are emitted to maintain a transparent transaction log.

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Save the contract in `contracts/MilestoneBasedEscrowContract.sol` and compile it:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deployment Script**:
   Create a deployment script `scripts/deploy.js`:
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const escrowTokenAddress = "0xYourERC20TokenAddress"; // Replace with the actual ERC20 token address
     const depositorAddress = "0xDepositorAddress"; // Replace with depositor address
     const beneficiaryAddress = "0xBeneficiaryAddress"; // Replace with beneficiary address

     const MilestoneBasedEscrowContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MilestoneBasedEscrowContract");
     const milestoneEscrow = await MilestoneBasedEscrowContract.deploy(depositorAddress, beneficiaryAddress, escrowTokenAddress);

     console.log("MilestoneBasedEscrowContract deployed to:", milestoneEscrow.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Additional Customization:

- **Custom Milestone Criteria**: Implement additional conditions for releasing funds, such as multi-signature approval, oracle-based verification, or predefined task completions.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Add a mechanism for dispute resolution, where a neutral party can mediate if either party contests the release of funds.
- **Escrow Fees**: Implement fees for the escrow service, which can be deducted from the deposited amount or be separately payable by either party.
