### **Key Features of the Contract:**

1. **Anonymous Reporting:**
   - Allows authorized reporters to anonymously submit reports of suspicious activities, ensuring privacy and compliance with AML requirements.

2. **Role-based Access Control:**
   - Only the designated AML compliance officer can view reports, ensuring that sensitive data is accessed only by authorized personnel.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Emits events for each reported activity, for AML compliance tracking.

4. **Compliance and Security:**
   - Ensures authorized reporters are the only ones allowed to submit reports.
   - Allows the owner to add or remove authorized reporters and update the AML compliance officer.

5. **Pausability:**
   - Allows the owner to pause and unpause the contract for emergencies or maintenance.

### **Deployment Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Node.js, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
     ```

2. **Deployment Script (deploy.js):**

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    console.log("Deploying contract with account:", deployer.address);

    const AMLComplianceOfficer = "0xYourComplianceOfficerAddress"; // Replace with actual AML compliance officer address

    const AnonymousAMLReporting = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("AnonymousAMLReporting");
    const contract = await AnonymousAMLReporting.deploy(AMLComplianceOfficer);

    await contract.deployed();
    console.log("AnonymousAMLReporting deployed to:", contract.address);
}

main().then(() => process.exit(0)).catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

3. **Deployment Steps:**
   - Save the contract as `4-1X_8C_Anonymous_AML_Reporting_Contract.sol` in the `contracts` directory.
   - Save the deployment script as `deploy.js` in the `scripts` directory.
   - Deploy the contract using:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network_name]
     ```

### **Test Suite (tests/AnonymousAMLReporting.test.js):**

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("AnonymousAMLReporting", function () {
    let AnonymousAMLReporting, contract, owner, complianceOfficer, reporter, unauthorizedUser;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [owner, complianceOfficer, reporter, unauthorizedUser] = await ethers.getSigners();

        const AnonymousAMLReporting = await ethers.getContractFactory("AnonymousAMLReporting");
        contract = await AnonymousAMLReporting.deploy(complianceOfficer.address);
        await contract.deployed();

        // Add reporter as an authorized reporter
        await contract.addAuthorizedReporter(reporter.address);
    });

    it("Should allow authorized reporters to report suspicious activity", async function () {
        await expect(contract.connect(reporter).reportSuspiciousActivity("Encrypted or Hashed Data"))
            .to.emit(contract, "SuspiciousActivityReported")
            .withArgs(1, reporter.address, await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest").then(block => block.timestamp));
    });

    it("Should not allow unauthorized reporters to report suspicious activity", async function () {
        await expect(contract.connect(unauthorizedUser).reportSuspiciousActivity("Invalid Data"))
            .to.be.revertedWith("Unauthorized reporter");
    });

    it("Should allow compliance officer to view reports", async function () {
        await contract.connect(reporter).reportSuspiciousActivity("Encrypted or Hashed Data");
        const report = await contract.connect(complianceOfficer).viewReport(1);
        expect(report[0]).to.equal(reporter.address);
        expect(report[1]).to.equal("Encrypted or Hashed Data");
    });

    it("Should not allow unauthorized users to view reports", async function () {
        await contract.connect(reporter).reportSuspiciousActivity("Encrypted or Hashed Data");
        await expect(contract.connect(unauthorizedUser).viewReport(1)).to.be.revertedWith("Only the AML compliance officer can perform this action");
    });
});
```

### **API Documentation:**

- **Functions:**
  - `reportSuspiciousActivity(string memory _details)`: Allows authorized reporters to report suspicious activities anonymously.
  - `viewReport(uint256 reportId)`: Allows the compliance officer to view details of a reported suspicious activity.
  - `addAuthorizedReporter(address reporter)`: Adds a new authorized reporter.
  - `removeAuthorizedReporter(address reporter)`: Removes an existing authorized reporter.
  - `setAMLComplianceOfficer(address _newOfficer)`: Sets a new AML compliance officer.
  - `pause()`: Pauses the contract.
  - `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract.

This smart contract ensures that suspicious activities can be reported anonymously while adhering to AML requirements, protecting user privacy and maintaining transparency in compliance monitoring.
