### **Key Features of the Contract:**

1. **Restricted Token Transfers:**
   - Integrates with the ERC1404 standard to restrict token transfers based on compliance rules.
   - Only compliant investors can hold or transfer tokens, ensuring regulatory compliance.

2. **Tax Compliance:**
   - Calculates and reports taxes for investors based on the taxable amount of their transactions.
   - Reports the withheld taxes to a designated tax authority, ensuring compliance with tax regulations.

3. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Compliance officers can manage tax rates and report taxes, ensuring that only authorized personnel manage tax operations.
   - The owner can add or remove compliance officers as needed.

4. **Dynamic Tax Rates:**
   - Allows compliance officers to set different tax rates for various partitions (e.g., different classes of restricted tokens).
   - Supports customized tax rates for different investor profiles and token classes.

5. **Event Logging:**
   - Logs events for tax reporting, tax rate updates, and tax authority changes, providing transparency for tax-related actions.

6. **Pausable Contract:**
   - The owner can pause and unpause the contract to control restricted token transactions in emergency situations.

### **Deployment Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Node.js, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
     ```

2. **Deployment Script (deploy.js):**

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    console.log("Deploying contract with account:", deployer.address);

    const InvestorTaxReportingContract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("InvestorTaxReportingContract");
    const controllers = ["0xControllerAddress1", "0xControllerAddress2"]; // Replace with actual controller addresses
    const initialTaxAuthority = "0xTaxAuthorityAddress"; // Replace with actual tax authority address

    const contract = await InvestorTaxReportingContract.deploy(
        "RestrictedToken", // Name of the restricted token
        "RST", // Symbol of the restricted token
        controllers,
        initialTaxAuthority
    );

    await contract.deployed();
    console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

3. **Deployment:**
   - Compile and deploy the contract using Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/deploy.js
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected under various conditions.
   - Include tests for tax calculations, tax rate updates, compliance rules, and restricted token transfers.

### **Additional Customization:**

1. **Advanced Compliance Rules:**
   - Implement additional compliance rules that restrict token transfers based on jurisdictional regulations or other criteria.
   - Integrate third-party services for real-time compliance checks.

2. **Oracle Integration:**
   - Use Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time data for dynamic tax rate adjustments based on market conditions or legal updates.

3. **Audit and Security:**
   - Conduct a third-party security audit to ensure the contract's security and compliance.
   - Implement advanced testing and formal verification for critical functions.

4. **Front-End Dashboard:**
   - Develop a user interface for compliance officers to manage tax rates, view tax reports, and configure compliance settings.
   - Provide a dashboard for investors to view their tax data and generate reports.

This smart contract provides a robust framework for managing tax compliance for accredited or authorized investors holding restricted tokens. It ensures that all tax obligations are met for both the issuer and the investor in compliance with relevant regulations.
