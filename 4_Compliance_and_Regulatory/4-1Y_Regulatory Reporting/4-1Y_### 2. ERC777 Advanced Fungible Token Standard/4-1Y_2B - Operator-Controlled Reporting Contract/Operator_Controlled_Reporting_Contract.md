### Solidity Smart Contract: 4-1Y_2B_Operator_Controlled_Reporting_Contract.sol

This smart contract leverages the ERC777 advanced fungible token standard to enable operator-controlled regulatory reporting. Designated operators, such as compliance officers or custodians, can manage and authorize the reporting process, ensuring that only verified data is submitted to regulatory bodies.

### **Key Features of the Contract:**

1. **ERC777 Token Standard:**
   - Implements the ERC777 standard for advanced fungible tokens, allowing operators to manage token transfers and recording of transfer purposes.

2. **Operator-Controlled Reporting:**
   - Designated operators can submit detailed reports of all token transfers, including sender, recipient, amount, and purpose. Compliance officers must authorize these reports before submission to ensure data integrity.

3. **Compliance and Authorization:**
   - The contract integrates a compliance check system, allowing only authorized compliance officers to approve the reports submitted by operators.

4. **Transfer Recording:**
   - Records all token transfers with their purposes, which are then included in the regulatory reports.

5. **Access Control:**
   - Utilizes OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to manage roles and permissions. The contract owner can grant or revoke the `OPERATOR_ROLE` and `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_ROLE` as needed.

6. **Pausing Mechanism:**
   - The contract owner can pause all token transfers in case of emergencies or regulatory requirements using OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Pausable` module.

### **Deployment Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Node.js, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
     ```

2. **Deployment Script (deploy.js):**

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    console.log("Deploying contract with account:", deployer.address);

    const name = "OperatorControlledToken";
    const symbol = "OCT777";
    const defaultOperators = []; // Default operators, can be left empty or defined as needed
    const Contract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("OperatorControlledReporting");
    const contract = await Contract.deploy(name, symbol, defaultOperators);

    await contract.deployed();
    console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

3. **Deployment:**
   - Compile and deploy the contract using Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/deploy.js
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Implement test cases for verifying:
     - Only operators can submit reports.
     - Only compliance officers can authorize reports.
     - All transfer data is recorded correctly.
     - The pause and unpause functionality works as expected.

### **Additional Customization:**
- Integration with Chainlink oracles for real-time data feeds and automated compliance alerts.
- Enhanced reporting functionalities, including scheduled reporting and automated notifications to authorities.
- Customizable compliance checks and reporting thresholds to align with specific regulatory requirements.

This contract provides a robust and secure framework for managing operator-controlled reporting and regulatory compliance within a tokenized ecosystem.
