### Solidity Smart Contract: 4-1Y_6C_StakingRedemptionReporting.sol

This smart contract is designed to comply with the ERC4626 standard and automates the reporting of staking activities and token redemptions to regulatory authorities. It ensures that any significant asset movements within tokenized vaults are documented and submitted to relevant authorities for review.

### **Key Features of the Contract:**

1. **ERC4626 Compliance:**
   - The contract complies with the ERC4626 standard, allowing it to manage deposits and withdrawals from tokenized vaults while adhering to compliance requirements.

2. **Staking and Redemption Functions:**
   - Handles staking and redemption of tokens, updating the total staked and redeemed values. Emits events for each staking and redemption activity to ensure transparency.

3. **Dynamic Reporting Threshold:**
   - Allows the owner to set and update a reporting threshold. This threshold determines when a report should be submitted to the regulatory authority based on the cumulative staked or redeemed values.

4. **Automated Reporting:**
   - Submits a report to the designated regulatory authority whenever the total staked or redeemed values exceed the set threshold, ensuring timely regulatory compliance.

5. **Event Logging:**
   - Emits events for staking, redemption, and report submission activities to facilitate tracking and auditing of asset movements within the vault.

6. **Emergency Controls:**
   - Provides the ability to pause and unpause the contract, allowing for a quick response to potential threats or regulatory changes.

### **Deployment Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Node.js, Hardhat, and OpenZeppelin Contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
     ```

2. **Deployment Script (deploy.js):**

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    console.log("Deploying contract with account:", deployer.address);

    const StakingRedemptionReporting = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("StakingRedemptionReporting");
    const vaultToken = "0xYourERC20AssetAddress"; // Replace with the ERC20 asset address
    const authorityAddress = "0xYourAuthorityAddress"; // Replace with actual authority address
    const reportingThreshold = hre.ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18); // Example threshold of 1,000 tokens

    const contract = await StakingRedemptionReporting.deploy(
        vaultToken, // ERC20 asset
        "Vault Token", // Vault name
        "VT", // Vault symbol
        authorityAddress, // Authority address
        reportingThreshold // Reporting threshold
    );

    await contract.deployed();
    console.log("Contract deployed to:", contract.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

3. **Deployment:**
   - Compile and deploy the contract using Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/deploy.js
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Implement test cases to verify:
     - Correct handling of staking and redemption transactions.
     - Accurate calculation of total staked and redeemed values.
     - Proper submission of reports to the regulatory authority.

### **Additional Customization:**

- **Enhanced Compliance Checks:**
  - Integrate with external KYC/AML providers to ensure that all participants meet the necessary compliance requirements before allowing staking or redemption activities.

- **Advanced Reporting Features:**
  - Include additional metadata in the reports, such as investor details, transaction timestamps, and compliance status.

- **Dynamic Stake and Redemption Logic:**
  - Implement logic to dynamically adjust staking and redemption limits based on market conditions or regulatory changes.

- **Real-Time Alerts:**
  - Integrate with monitoring tools to provide real-time alerts for significant staking or redemption activities, enabling faster response times.

This contract can be deployed and customized to meet specific requirements for reporting staking and redemption activities within tokenized vaults, ensuring compliance and transparency for fund managers.
