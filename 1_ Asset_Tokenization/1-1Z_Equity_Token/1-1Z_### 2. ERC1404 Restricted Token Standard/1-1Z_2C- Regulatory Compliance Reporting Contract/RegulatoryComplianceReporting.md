### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Compliance Reporting**:
   - `generateComplianceReport(address regulator)`: This function generates a regulatory compliance report based on transaction history. In practice, this would trigger an off-chain process that delivers a compliance report to a designated regulator.

2. **Compliance Status**:
   - `setComplianceStatus(address account, bool status)`: Updates the compliance status of individual token holders to ensure only compliant entities can hold or transfer tokens.

3. **Restricted Transfers**:
   - The `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions are overridden to ensure that transfers are only allowed between compliant entities. Non-compliant addresses cannot send or receive tokens.

4. **Transaction History**:
   - All token transfers are recorded in the `transactionHistory[]` array, which includes details such as the sender, recipient, amount, and timestamp of each transfer.

5. **Pausable Contract**:
   - The contract can be paused by an admin to temporarily block all token transfers if needed for security or compliance reasons.

6. **Minting and Burning**:
   - Admins can mint new tokens or burn tokens from a specific address using the `mint()` and `burn()` functions.

7. **Access Control**:
   - The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for role management, ensuring that only authorized addresses can manage compliance, mint tokens, or generate reports.

### Deployment Instructions:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Compile the contract using Hardhat or Truffle:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   Example Hardhat deployment script:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);
     console.log("Account balance:", (await deployer.getBalance()).toString());

     const RegulatoryComplianceReporting = await ethers.getContractFactory("RegulatoryComplianceReporting");
     const token = await RegulatoryComplianceReporting.deploy("Compliance Equity Token", "CET", ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));
     await token.deployed();

     console.log("Regulatory Compliance Reporting Contract deployed to:", token.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

4. **Run the Deployment Script**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
   ```

5. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Ensure the contract passes all tests by writing test cases for each core functionality (compliance status, restricted transfers, and reporting).
   - Have the contract audited for security and compliance by a trusted third-party auditor.

6. **Off-Chain Integration**:
   - To send compliance reports to a regulator, you can integrate the contract with an off-chain system that listens for the `RegulatoryReportGenerated` event and sends the data via email or API to the designated regulator.

This contract is designed to automate compliance checks and generate reports, helping companies meet their regulatory obligations when issuing and managing equity tokens.
