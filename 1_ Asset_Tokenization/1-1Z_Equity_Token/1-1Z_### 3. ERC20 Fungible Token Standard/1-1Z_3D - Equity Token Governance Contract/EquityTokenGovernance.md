### Key Features of the Contract:

1. **Governance Mechanisms**:
   - `createProposal(string description)`: Allows token holders to create a new proposal.
   - `vote(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows token holders to vote on proposals using their token balance as voting weight.
   - `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows the owner to execute proposals that have met the minimum quorum requirement.

2. **Minting and Burning**:
   - `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to mint new tokens.
   - `burn(address from, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to burn tokens from a specified address.

3. **Pausing**:
   - `pause()`: Pauses all minting, burning, and governance operations.
   - `unpause()`: Unpauses all operations.

4. **Emergency Withdrawals**:
   - `emergencyWithdrawETH()`: Allows the owner to withdraw ETH mistakenly sent to the contract.
   - `emergencyWithdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw ERC20 tokens mistakenly sent to the contract.

5. **Governance Configurations**:
   - `updateMinimumQuorum(uint256 newQuorum)`: Allows the owner to update the minimum quorum for proposals.
   - `updateProposalDuration(uint256 newDuration)`: Allows the owner to update the duration of proposals.

6. **Modifiers and Checks**:
   - `onlyTokenHolders`: Restricts functions to be callable only by token holders.
   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts functions to be callable only by the contract owner.
   - `whenNotPaused`: Restricts functions to be callable only when the contract is not paused.
   - `nonReentrant`: Prevents reentrancy attacks in emergency withdrawal functions.

7. **Fallback Function**:
   - `receive()`: Allows the contract to accept ETH deposits.

8. **Compliance**:
   - Complies with the ERC20 standard using OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` implementation.
   - Utilizes OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Ownable`, `ReentrancyGuard`, and `Pausable` contracts for secure and robust functionality.

### Deployment Instructions:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have OpenZeppelin installed:
   ```bash
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   Compile the contract using Hardhat or Truffle:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
   Example Hardhat deployment script:
   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);
     console.log("Account balance:", (await deployer.getBalance()).toString());

     const EquityTokenGovernance = await ethers.getContractFactory("EquityTokenGovernance");
     const token = await EquityTokenGovernance.deploy("Equity Governance Token", "EGT", 1000, 604800);
     await token.deployed();

     console.log("Equity Token Governance Contract deployed to:", token.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

4.

 **Run the Deployment Script**:
   Deploy the contract using Hardhat:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
   ```

5. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Write test cases to ensure that the governance functionalities work as expected, and that only the owner can mint and burn tokens.
   - Conduct thorough testing for edge cases such as double voting, and unauthorized minting.
   - Consider getting the contract audited to ensure it meets security and compliance standards.

6. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement quadratic voting for governance decisions.
   - Integrate with oracles for dynamic proposal validation.
   - Add multi-signature capabilities for higher security on executing proposals.

This contract provides a comprehensive governance framework for companies to allow their equity token holders to participate in corporate decisions, ensuring decentralized and transparent decision-making.
