### Contract Explanation:

1. **Accredited Investor Management:**
   - The contract maintains a mapping of investor addresses to their accreditation status.
   - Functions are provided to verify and de-accredit investors.

2. **Events:**

### Deployment Instructions:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed.
   - Install OpenZeppelin contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
     ```

2. **Deployment Script:**
   Create a deployment script `deploy.js` in the `scripts` folder:

   ```javascript
   const hre = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const AccreditedInvestorVerification = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("AccreditedInvestorVerification");
     const verificationContract = await AccreditedInvestorVerification.deploy();
     await verificationContract.deployed();
     console.log("Accredited Investor Verification deployed to:", verificationContract.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

3. **Run the Deployment Script:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

### Testing Suite:

1. **Basic Tests:**
   Use Mocha and Chai for testing core functions such as verification and de-accreditation.

   ```javascript
   const { expect } = require("chai");

   describe("AccreditedInvestorVerification", function () {
     let verificationContract;
     let owner, investor;

     beforeEach(async function () {
       [owner, investor] = await ethers.getSigners();
       const AccreditedInvestorVerification = await ethers.getContractFactory("AccreditedInvestorVerification");
       verificationContract = await AccreditedInvestorVerification.deploy();
       await verificationContract.deployed();
     });

     it("Should allow the owner to verify an investor", async function () {
       await verificationContract.verifyInvestor(investor.address);
       expect(await verificationContract.isAccredited(investor.address)).to.equal(true);
     });

     it("Should allow the owner to de-accredit an investor", async function () {
       await verificationContract.verifyInvestor(investor.address);
       await verificationContract.deAccreditInvestor(investor.address);
       expect(await verificationContract.isAccredited(investor.address)).to.equal(false);
     });

     it("Should allow bulk accreditation of investors", async function () {
       const investors = [investor.address, ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address];
       await verificationContract.verifyMultipleInvestors(investors);
       for (const addr of investors) {
         expect(await verificationContract.isAccredited(addr)).to.equal(true);
       }
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
