Hereâ€™s a complete smart contract for the **Profit and Performance Fee Sharing Contract** using the ERC777 standard. This contract automates the sharing of profits and performance fees, allowing fund managers to receive their share based on predefined terms while distributing returns to token holders.

### Contract Explanation:

1. **Token Management:**
   - Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC777`, providing advanced token features and operator permissions.

2. **Profit Management:**
   - `reportProfits`: Allows the owner (fund manager) to report profits generated by the fund.
   - `distributePerformanceFees`: Distributes performance fees based on the total profits and the predefined fee percentage.

3. **Event Emission:**
   - Emits events for profit distribution and performance fee payments to enhance transparency.

4. **Performance Fee Withdrawal:**
   - Allows fund managers to withdraw their accumulated performance fees.

### Deployment Instructions:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed.
   - Install OpenZeppelin contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
     ```

2. **Deployment Script:**
   Create a deployment script `deploy.js` in the `scripts` folder:

   ```javascript
   const hre = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const defaultOperators = []; // Add any default operators if needed
     const performanceFeePercentage = 20; // Set initial performance fee percentage to 20%
     const ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing");
     const token = await ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing.deploy("Hedge Fund Token", "HFT", defaultOperators, performanceFeePercentage);

     await token.deployed();
     console.log("Profit and Performance Fee Sharing Contract deployed to:", token.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

3. **Run the Deployment Script:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

### Testing Suite:

1. **Basic Tests:**
   Use Mocha and Chai for testing core functions such as profit reporting, fee distribution, and withdrawal.

   ```javascript
   const { expect } = require("chai");

   describe("Profit and Performance Fee Sharing", function () {
     let contract;
     let owner, fundManager, investor1;

     beforeEach(async function () {
       [owner, fundManager, investor1] = await ethers.getSigners();

       const ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing = await ethers.getContractFactory("ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing");
       const defaultOperators = [];
       const performanceFeePercentage = 20; // 20% performance fee
       contract = await ProfitAndPerformanceFeeSharing.deploy("Hedge Fund Token", "HFT", defaultOperators, performanceFeePercentage);
       await contract.deployed();
     });

     it("Should allow owner to report profits", async function () {
       await contract.reportProfits(1000);
       expect(await contract.getTotalProfits()).to.equal(1000);
     });

     it("Should distribute performance fees correctly", async function () {
       await contract.reportProfits(1000);
       await contract.distributePerformanceFees();

       const performanceFee = await contract.performanceFees(owner.address);
       expect(performanceFee).to.equal(200); // 20% of 1000
     });

     it("Should allow fund manager to withdraw performance fees", async function () {
       await contract.reportProfits(1000);
       await contract.distributePerformanceFees();

       const initialBalance = await owner.getBalance();
       await contract.withdrawPerformanceFee();

       const newBalance = await owner.getBalance();
       expect(newBalance).to.be.above(initialBalance); // Balance should increase
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

### Documentation:

1. **API Documentation:**
   - Include detailed NatSpec comments for each function, event, and modifier in the contract.

2. **User Guide:**
   - Provide step-by-step instructions on how to manage profits and performance fees.

3. **Developer Guide:**
   - Explain the contract architecture, including performance fee calculations and management.
