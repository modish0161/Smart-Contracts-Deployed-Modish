### Smart Contract: 2-1X_8A_AccreditedInvestorVerification.sol

#### Overview
This smart contract utilizes privacy-preserving AnonCreds for verifying the accreditation status of mutual fund token holders. It ensures that only accredited investors can participate in the tokenized mutual funds without revealing sensitive personal information, thereby maintaining compliance with privacy and regulatory requirements.

### Contract Explanation:

1. **Accredited Investor Verification:**
   - This contract stores and verifies the accreditation status of investors using privacy-preserving credentials.
   - The accreditation status is verified using a digital signature from a trusted verification authority. 

2. **Investor Struct:**
   - Stores the investor's accreditation status (`isAccredited`) and its expiry date (`expiry`).

3. **Verification Function:**
   - `verifyInvestor()` allows the contract owner to verify and add an accredited investor using a signature from the verification authority.
   - The signature is verified to ensure the authenticity of the accreditation claim without revealing personal information.

4. **Invest and Withdraw Functions:**
   - The `invest()` function allows only accredited investors to invest in the mutual fund by transferring ERC20 mutual fund tokens to the contract.
   - The `withdraw()` function allows only accredited investors to withdraw their investments.

5. **Verification Authority:**
   - The `verificationAuthority` variable stores the address of the authority responsible for signing accreditation claims.
   - This authority can be changed by the contract owner if needed.

6. **Ownership and Control:**
   - The contract owner has control over adding and removing investors and setting the mutual fund token address and verification authority.

7. **Security Considerations:**
   - The contract uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks on critical functions.
   - `onlyAccreditedInvestor` modifier ensures that only verified investors can access certain functions.

### Deployment Instructions:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed.
   - Install OpenZeppelin contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
     ```

2. **Deployment Script:**
   Create a deployment script `deploy.js` in the `scripts` folder:

   ```javascript
   const hre = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const MutualFundToken = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20Token");
     const mutualFundToken = await MutualFundToken.deploy("Mutual Fund Token", "MFT", 18, 1000000);
     await mutualFundToken.deployed();

     console.log("Mutual Fund Token deployed to:", mutualFundToken.address);

     const AccreditedInvestorVerification = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("AccreditedInvestorVerification");
     const accreditedInvestorVerification = await AccreditedInvestorVerification.deploy(mutualFundToken.address, deployer.address);

     await accreditedInvestorVerification.deployed();
     console.log("Accredited Investor Verification deployed to:", accreditedInvestorVerification.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

3. **Run the Deployment Script:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

### Testing Suite:

1. **Basic Tests:**
   Use Mocha and Chai for testing core functions such as verifying investors, adding investors, and removing investors.

   ```javascript
   const { expect } = require("chai");

   describe("Accredited Investor Verification", function () {
     let accreditedInvestorVerification, mutualFundToken;
     let owner, investor1, investor2;

     beforeEach(async function () {
       [owner, investor1, investor2] = await ethers.getSigners();

       const MockERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockERC20");
       mutualFundToken = await MockERC20.deploy("Mock Token", "MKT", 18, 1000000);
       await mutualFundToken.deployed();

       const AccreditedInvestorVerification = await ethers.getContractFactory("AccreditedInvestorVerification");
       accreditedInvestorVerification = await AccreditedInvestorVerification.deploy(mutualFundToken.address, owner.address);
       await accreditedInvestorVerification.deployed();
     });

     it("Should allow verification of an investor", async function () {
       const message = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
         ["address", "uint256"],
         [investor1.address, Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400]
       );
       const signature = await owner.signMessage(ethers.utils.arrayify(message));

       await accreditedInvestorVerification.verifyInvestor(
         investor1.address,
         Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400,
         signature
       );

       const investor = await accreditedInvestorVerification.investors(investor1.address);
       expect(investor.isAccredited).to.equal(true);
     });

     it("Should not allow unverified investors to invest", async function () {
       await expect(
         accreditedInvestorVerification.connect(investor2).invest(100)
       ).to.be.revertedWith("Not an accredited investor");
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
